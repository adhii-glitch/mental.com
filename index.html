      <h1>My Amul, Sweet heart ❤️</h1>
      <p class="letter-text">
        I don’t know how to put this into perfect words… but I just want you to know from the deepest part of my heart — I love you. ❤️ I love you more than anything, more than anyone, more than I ever thought was possible.<br><br>
        You are the most precious person in my life. Every moment I spend with you feels like a blessing. When I think about my future, I can’t see anything without you in it. I want you in all of it — in every smile, every tear, every fight, every hug 🤗, every success, and even the failures… I want us to go through everything together.<br><br>
        There might be tough days ahead. Life is never always easy. But I promise, I will stand with you in every situation, through every storm. 🌧️ I don’t want to face life alone — I want us. You and me, hand in hand, no matter what comes our way. 🤝<br><br>
        Please, Amul... don’t ever leave me. 🥺 Don’t walk away. You are my heart, my peace, my everything. Without you, I feel empty. 💔 I need you to stay, to believe in our love, just like I do. 💞<br><br>
        Let’s try together to convince everyone. Let’s show our families that what we share is real, pure, and unbreakable. I believe, from the bottom of my soul, that if they truly see our love, they will understand and support us.<br><br>
        Let’s build our future — one filled with love, understanding, and endless hugs 🤗❤️
        Just you and me, forever and always.<br><br>
        I will love you always, more than words, more than life itself. 💖<br><br>
        With all my heart,<br>
        <strong>Adhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 🤗❤️</strong>
